        Your task is to generate one Content Rating type and as many Content Descriptors as appropriate for the following topic and questions en masse.
        Choose from the following Content Rating types:
            - Everyone
            - Teen
            - Mature
            - AdultsOnly
            - RatingPending

        And the following Content Descriptors:
            - AlcoholReference
            - DrugReference
            - Language
            - SexualContent
            - MedicalTerminology

        It's ok for a content rating to have no descriptors.

        Format your result as a JSON object e.g. {type: "ContentRatingType", descriptors: ["descriptor1", "descriptor2", "descriptor3"]}
        Ensure the response is valid JSON.
